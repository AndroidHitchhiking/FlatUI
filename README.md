Android FlatUI
===================

FlatUI is a library that lets you use native android widgets with a better and customized look.

You can define the widgets in XML or create on run time in JAVA. Even though the widgets are customized, you can create your styles with attributes.

There are many predefined themes inside this library but you can also use your own colors easily.

!!! There may be some unexpected results with different screen resolutions and different Android versions. If you have some problems or solutions to those problems please let me know.
